I'm a Malaysian American based in NYC for the past decade or so who has always wanted to learn how to code for the longest time and the day has finally come! There is a silverlining in everything that has been going on in 2020 despite the many chanlleges. I was furloughed from my job in the travel industry and it has given me the extra drive to take advantage of the downtime I have. Thanks to Career Karma, I followed through with my life long calling and applied to Flatiron School's part-time Software Engineering course.
