Ever since I sat in the first internet cafe in the suburbs of Petaling Jaya, Selangor in *Malaysia* with my middle school friends circa mid-90s and started chatting on [mIRC](http://https://www.mirc.com/), I was fascinated with the inner workings of technology. Since then I have always been reletively tech savvy, but felt the need to delve deeper into the more technical side of what is behind the social media platforms, websites, and applications that I used on a daily. I had always dreamed of developing my own website and jotted down so many ideas for applications, but I don't know where to even start! I would have to rely on hiring a developer to do that for me. Firstly, I can't afford to hire one nor would I exploit a developer friend's skills to help do me a "favor" to build this dream website and app I had envisioned in my head for so long, but it probably wouldn't turn out the way I really wanted it to. To fully feel fulfilled in making that come true, I thought the best way is to learn how and not have to rely on anybody to make that happen. In addition to that, career wise I had fallen into a administrative role which I didn't foresee would be the case after 15 years of work experience in Media, Marketing and Communication. With the skills that I hope to acquire when I do complete this part-time Software Engineering course at Flatiron School, the next step would be to fully break into tech and grow both personally and professionally. Here's to the first day of the rest of my life - here we go!
